Description: Provides a CAPTCHA for Python using the reCAPTCHA service. Does not require
        any imaging libraries because the CAPTCHA is served directly from reCAPTCHA.
        Also allows you to securely obfuscate emails with Mailhide. This functionality
        requires pycrypto. This library requires two types of API keys. If you'd like
        to use the CAPTCHA, you'll need a key from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create.
        For Mailhide, you'll need a key from http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey.
        
        The trunk can be checked out from
        http://recaptcha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/recaptcha-plugins/python,
        and the associated Google Code project lives at
        http://code.google.com/p/recaptcha. Note that this is a shared
        project/repository for reCAPTCHA clients for several languages/environments.
        
        There is also a Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/recaptcha/.
        Please use the associated mailing list for any questions or comments:
        recaptcha@googlegroups.com. Like the Google Code project, the Google Group
        mailing list is also shared among the several reCAPTCHA client implementations.
